# 🚀 Typing Speed Test — Frontend Mentor Solution

This is my solution to the [Typing Speed Test challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/typing-speed-test).  
Frontend Mentor challenges help developers improve real-world frontend skills by building projects from professional designs.

This project is being developed **individually**, with a strong focus on **pixel-perfect UI**, **responsiveness**, and **clean layout architecture**.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device’s screen size
- Experience smooth transitions between different test states
- Interact with a clean and distraction-free typing interface
- See clear visual feedback for typing statistics

## My Process

This project is being built incrementally, with an emphasis on **understanding the design deeply**, writing **scalable UI code**, and solving layout challenges properly rather than using quick fixes.

---

### Day-by-Day Progress

#### **Day 1 — Project Setup & Foundations**

On the first day, I focused on laying a strong foundation for the project.

**What I worked on:**
- Set up the React application
- Added all required SVGs, icons, and assets
- Configured Tailwind CSS
- Organized a clean and scalable folder structure
- Began writing base styles using Tailwind
- Started implementing the desktop “not started” page
- Explored strategies for adding responsiveness for mobile and tablet
- Created initial components such as the header and statistics metrics

**Key takeaway:**  
Building a clean structure early makes complex UI work much easier later.

---

#### **Day 2 — Pixel-Perfect Desktop & Figma Mastery**

This day was dedicated to precision and design accuracy.

**What I worked on:**
- Created a pixel-perfect laptop (desktop) layout matching the Figma design
- Built all required components for:
  - Desktop “not started” page
  - Desktop “started” page
- Began implementing the tablet layout
- Spent significant time understanding spacing, typography, and layout constraints from Figma
- Improved my ability to translate design tokens into Tailwind utilities

**Big learning:**  
I became much more confident in reading and interpreting Figma designs instead of relying on guesswork.

### Built With

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Figma (design reference)

---

### What I Learned

- How to build no-scroll, full-screen layouts correctly
- Why margins can cause overflow in fixed-height layouts
- How to use Flexbox, `flex-1`, and `gap` instead of stacking margins
- How Tailwind’s mobile-first breakpoints work in practice
- How to read spacing and layout rules accurately from Figma

---

### Challenges Faced

- Preventing vertical overflow while maintaining visual balance
- Handling responsiveness without duplicating components
- Translating design-system spacing into Tailwind utilities
- Debugging layout issues caused by `h-screen` combined with margins
- Maintaining pixel perfection across screen sizes

---

### Continued Development

Planned next steps:
- Complete tablet and mobile layouts
- Implement typing logic and state management
- Improve accessibility and keyboard interactions
- Add subtle animations and polish
- Optimize performance and overall UX
- Finalize screenshots and live deployment
